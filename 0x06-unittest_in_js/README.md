In JavaScript, unit testing using Mocha and Chai is a popular approach for testing individual units of code.



**Mocha** is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js. It provides functions like describe() to group related tests and it() to define individual test cases. Mocha is great for asynchronous testing, and it allows flexible test setups and cleanups.

**Chai** is an assertion library often used with Mocha. It offers different styles of assertions, like assert, expect, and should, to check if code behaves as expected. It helps make tests more readable and expressive.

Together, Mocha and Chai allow developers to write clear, structured, and maintainable tests for JavaScript applications.
